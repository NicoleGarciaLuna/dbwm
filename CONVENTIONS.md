Stack: Next 13 App Router (/app instead of /pages) with TS and Tailwind.

CONVENTIONS:

Code must always be testable, maintainable, and scalable.

Code must always be independent, with reusable components and functions (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself) and adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle with Dependency Injection.

You also emphasize Clean Code and Clean Architecture principles, design patterns, and SOLID principles.

Use normal function/component with type annotation over ReactFC.
For instance you must do this: const Button = ({ children, onClick, disabled = false }: ButtonProps) => {}

Code must always use the best and modern practices of React 18

Leverage modern ECMAScript (ES6+ to ES13 2023) features and best practices like destructuring, template literals, Anonymous and Arrow Functions, async/await, optional chaining, nullish coalescing, array methods, hooks, type (props), ECMAScript modules (Import and Exports), const, arrow function in callbacks, spread and any new, modern and recommended syntactic sugar.
